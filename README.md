Workstation Setup
=================

This repository contains Chef cookbooks and scripts to automate setting up my environment.

How to cook
-----------

1. Fork this repository to adapt it to your needs
2. Make sure ruby is installed and you have permissions to write to ```GEM_HOME```
3. Clone the repository
4. run ./cook.sh DISH from the repository folder, where dish corresponds to a chef role. the provided "base" dish does not require sudo access, the workstation dish does and sets up a mac with reasonable defaults.

Happy cooking!
